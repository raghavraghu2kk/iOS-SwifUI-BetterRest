# iOS-SwifUI-BetterRest
The actual app we’re building is called BetterRest, and it’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:  When do they want to wake up? Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want? Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.
